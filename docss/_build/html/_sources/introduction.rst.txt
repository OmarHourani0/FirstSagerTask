Introduction
============

My first Django project which is inteded to make me learn Django.

I made this project which recieves data from simulated drones using MQTT, then the project processes the data and displayes it on simple html pages using APIs.
In addidition to having regular REST APIs to access the data, I have imoplemented a WebSocket API to allow real-time updates of the data on the web pages.
The project also has an admin page and some pages require you to be logged in to access them.

**The features of this project are:**

- Real-time telemetry updates via Django Channels and WebSockets
- MQTT integration for high-throughput telemetry ingestion
- PostgreSQL-backed data persistence
- Redis-backed channel layer for scalable asynchronous communication
- Interactive drone tracking map and telemetry dashboards
- Custom query interface for advanced telemetry inspection
- Modular and dockerized deployment workflow
